<h3 align="center">Why use this library?</h3>

-----

This library offers precise and customizable projectile trajectory calculations in Minecraft. Unlike other implementations, it provides modular utilities for handling various Minecraft projectiles, from arrows to firework rockets. With physics simulations that include gravity, air resistance, and velocity calculations, this library is an essential tool for any advanced Minecraft bot that needs to interact with projectiles.

Examples will be added as the project undergoes more development.

<h3 align="center">What is left to be done?</h3>

-----

- [X] Basic projectile trajectory calculations
- [X] Gravity and air resistance modeling
- [ ] Advanced projectile interactions (e.g., collision detection)
- [ ] Multi-environment compatibility (e.g., underwater, in the Nether)
- [ ] Optimizing the physics engine for performance
